# Loan-Approval-Predictor
This project builds a machine learning-based loan approval predictor in Python using Pandas for data preprocessing and scikit-learn for model development. By analyzing features like credit score, income, and employment history, the model accurately predicts loan approvals, helping lenders streamline decisions through data-driven insights.
